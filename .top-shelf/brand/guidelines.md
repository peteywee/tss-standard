# Top Shelf Service Brand Guidelines (TSSAS)

This folder is the canonical source of brand tokens and documentation for Top Shelf Service projects.

## Brand Principles
- Consistency: all UI uses the same tokens.
- Accessibility: contrast and readable typography are required.
- Simplicity: minimal components, predictable patterns.

## Token Usage Rules
- Colors are defined in `.top-shelf/brand/colors.json`.
- Typography is defined in `.top-shelf/brand/typography.json`.
- Projects should map these tokens into Tailwind via CSS variables.

## Project Expectations
- Do not hardcode hex colors in components.
- Use token names (semantic) rather than raw values.

Status: Initial v0 (tokens are placeholders until you drop the official palette).
